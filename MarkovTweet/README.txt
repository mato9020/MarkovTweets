Running the program will use Markov chain algorithm to randomly generate text based off of the contents of "input.txt". The longer the input text, the better the results (if the input is too short, the output will be very similar).

If you want to adjust the randomness or the length of the output, at the end of main.cpp look for the function called createTweet() and change the arguments.
